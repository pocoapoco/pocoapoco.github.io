A certain part of me knew that I am never able to speak English. It's a different kind of incapability, different than not being able to think about numbers in it, but rather, symmetrically yet reversely, like an image in the mirror-- I am probably only able to speak in English. The projection of the words would form a shape, a shape that describes me.

A once told me that ambiguity is rare in Japanese, because the constructs are so few and the concepts they carry so simple, that you can effectively inverse the words when speaking and a listener would still be able to understand what you're trying to convey. I did not believe him. But it would have been so nice to have that kind of certainty.  

I would listen to the resonance of the emulation, like an instrument filled with music, and the music is like a powerful vapour. The vapour as GG said-- moving around the chairs and walls, and that it like love, extends itself all the time, so that we can even love with our senseless nails: we love even with our clothes, so that a sleeve can feel a sleeve. Some other times that vapour is emmited like uncontrollable passion of a tyrannical king's heart.
