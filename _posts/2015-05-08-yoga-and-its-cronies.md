As you read this, you will propably already know, what I mean with that word. I strongly believe you also have some friends or family doing it.

First, let's quickly get to know what Yoga even is. According to Wikipedia, it's a Â»physical, mental, and spiritual practice or disciplineÂ« which is - in our society - mostly used by people who want to focus and leave their daily stress and work-pressure behind.

**That's exactly what worries me.** I certainly don't think that Yoga is a bad thing at all, when done in the right way. It helps you to be more happy and that's great, right? So I don't have a problem with the thing itself, I have a "problem" with the reason why most (not all) people are choosing to do it.

I think theyâ€™re trying to get away from things they donâ€™t like. Instead of facing the truth and doing something to improve the situation and stepping forward, they just want to fade it out. And that is - in my opinion - not useful when developing a great life. Theyâ€™re imagining that theyâ€™re just ameliorating their health and mind - but whatâ€™s really happening is that theyâ€™re escaping from the bad side of their life.

That was a bit confusing, huh? I hope you understand, what I want to communicate you: Just put all your effort into creating the life you want and donâ€™t flee from those decisions (of course just a suggestion, I don't want to be a preacher ðŸ˜¬).
