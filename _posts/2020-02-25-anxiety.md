Brighton Rock was absurdly pleasant to read. Ian McEwan said one of the first lessons he took from it was that a serious novel could be an exciting novel-- that the novel of adventure could also be the novel of ideas. I've just realized how incredibly true it was. 

If somebody's going to play Ida Arnold it has to be the actress who played Joan Holloway in Mad Men.
