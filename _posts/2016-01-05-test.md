title: Programming is a cure for depression. Because it keeps your brain running so that boredom doesn't have a chance to intrude; although problems can be so hard to solve it makes you frustrated now and again, once you make it it brings gigantic feel of accoplishment and you don't ever need any other kind of reward. Then you'll begin to enjoy the process of solving which is the more fundamental fun part. And day after day you become smarter and smarter.
