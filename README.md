This is where I settle down to write down my thoughts. Sometimes it's a helpful tip, sometimes an idea and sometimes just a random thought. There's only one thing I can guarantee: Before you become bored, the hell will freeze over.

So I guess there's only one thing left to clarify. And that's why the fuck I'm hosting my site here, in a repository on a collaborating platform for code: Because it's so convenient. I don't need to worry about deployment and at the same time, people can access all of my stuff without detours.

## Caught a bug?

Clone it

```sh

```

Install Jekyll and a special gem from GitHub

```sh
gem install jekyll github-pages
```

Run Jekyll within the repo! :dizzy:

```sh
cd leo.github.io
jekyll serve --watch
```
