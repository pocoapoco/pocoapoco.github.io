Oh, didn't see you there! Looks like you figured out how to access this page — time to give you what you want!

Okay, then let's start right over! If you haven't noticed it already by reading my essays, I'm a web developer. And by this, I don't mean a trained one. The stuff I learned on this topic until now didn't come from an educational career.

Beginning with homepage builders in the sixth class, I started figuring out my way through the web jungle by myself.

## Some history

Since I'm *just* 17 years old, I'm not able to rave about my first Macintosh 128K or something like that in this place. Therefore you're probably not able to relate that much to my career, but who cares? I got my first computer (which was a 300,00€ notebook from Dell) when I was 8 and I think it had Windows Vista pre-installed.

Since then, I went from drag-and-dropping custom fields in HPBK or Jimdo, over disassembling all kinds of websites, publishing fancy homepage builder [themes][1] together with a friend - and even [hosting websites][2] and minecraft maps on my own root server - to creating beautiful, performant and standard-compliant websites and -apps. In between, there was a mixture of making really bad-looking [web-designs][3] and youtube backgrounds (back then, the channels were a bit more colorful) for friends, [publishing tech-news][4] and offering tools for webmasters on a site called "Lion-System".

Just to name a few. The list goes on and on, and I didn't even mention the time when I coded sites for different companys using CMS2Day, WordPress or static code. I also coded many WordPress plugins (I published a few of them [here][5]), the current site of [Cutting Egg][6] (the team I worked with the last time) and countless ones for agencies which don't even exist anymore. Back then, I made most of them entirely for free. And when I got money, I made around 50,00 - 200,00 € for the whole development process.

Thankfully, I was able to make a big step out of this mess and get a job at [medienreaktor][7], where I started developing sites in addition to school in 2014. Since I also graduated from school now, I'm happy to start my training in the area of design there.

## Technical stuff

The site is built using Jekyll, the Liquid markup format and entirely deployed using GitHub Pages. Before I got here, the site was hosted on WordPress, Ghost and Tumblr (which I needed to ditch because I wanted the maximum of performance for my visitors).

The great thing about Jekyll is that I'm able to keep my posts in a clean way. Besides that, it's of course extremely fast and as if this wasn't enough, also completely free of charge. Since GitHub is also hosting all Pages on a CDN, my readers get the most power and I don't need to worry about stuff like php.ini settings, caching or minification.

If you want to read more about the process of building this site, just take a read on [this post][8].

## What else?

I love HipHop, designing interfaces (even if I don’t yet know how to do it properly), black tea[^1] and [animated short films][9]. Besides that, I enjoy pushing products forward together with other people.

I'm currently located in [Bamberg][10], a small town with a beautiful, medieval flair. Since I was born and raised here, I'm really proud of all the cultural facets we still have to offer. But I also really like seeing different parts of the world!
