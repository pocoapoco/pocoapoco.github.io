Well, study notes on shuati and other things worth taking notes for if any. ( ﾟｰﾟ)

## Some history

// Note implemented yet.

## This site

The site is borrowed from [Leonard Lamprecht][1]. I hardly changed anything because it's simple, fast and beautiful, looks pretty much what I wanted a blog to be. Also it's built using Jekyll, and everything happens in the local directory and is checked in to git. which is good.

## What else?

By the start of 2016, my interest is in computer science which I'm actively studying and hope to have a career with. I also like reading novels (reading less often lately because studying is taking a higher priority and most of my time), numbingly spicy hot pot[^1], oyster mushrooms, clementines and milk bubble tea. Besides that, I enjoy playing good games such as limbo, monument valley, civilization V, does not commute, etc.

I'm living in Los Alamos with Kun, although physically I'm in Boston doing grad school and internship. Kun and I were born and raised in [Xi'an][2], one of China's most beautifuland ancient cities.
