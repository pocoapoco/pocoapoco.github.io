Well, study notes on shuati and other things worth taking notes of if any. ( ﾟｰﾟ)

## Some history

// Not implemented yet.

## This site

The design of this site is by [Leonard Lamprecht][1]. I hardly changed anything because it's simple, fast and precise. It's built using Jekyll, although I'm not using Jekyll's build tools.

## What else?

By the start of 2016, my interest is in computer science which I'm actively studying and hope to have a career with. I also like reading novels, by Graham Greene, Guxiang and John Irving, particularly (less often lately though since shuati is taking a higher priority and most of my time), numbingly spicy hot pot[^1], oyster mushrooms, clementines and milk bubble tea. Besides that, I enjoy playing good games such as limbo, monument valley, civilization V, does not commute, etc.

I'm living in Los Alamos with [Kun][3], although physically I'm in Boston doing grad school and internship. Kun and I were born and raised in [Xi'an][2], one of China's most beautiful and ancient cities.
