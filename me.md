Hello, this is Sijing! It's the beginning of 2020 and one of my new year's resolutions is to start a blog again soooo-- here it is. ( ﾟｰﾟ)


## This site

Things that I do, eat, read, and think about.

## What else?

I'm living in New York. It's one of the most walkable cities I've been to, the food is fantastic, and I like that it's (quote from a bus billboard) "a city where everyone has a PhD in not giving a shit". I was born and raised in [Xi'an][2], one of China's most beautiful and ancient cities.
